        <h1>ZBLL Algorithms</h1>
        <p>
            ZBLL is short for Zborowski-Bruchem Last Layer, and it is used to solve the entire last layer in 1 step. This algorithm set can be used when the last layer edges are oriented. Therefore, ZBLL is a subset of full 1-look last layer, which has approximately 6x as many algorithms because there are 6 cases for edge orientation.
        </p>
        <p>
            ZBLL is useful in many methods, including CFOP, Roux, and ZZ. Advanced cubers may decide to learn some or all of ZBLL depending on their goals.
