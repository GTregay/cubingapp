        We use a memorization technique called <i>spaced repetition</i>. This
        means that you'll see an algorithm less often if you get it right, and
        more often if you get it wrong. The algorithms are automatically spaced
        out so you can memorize in the most efficient way possible.

        If you prefer to scramble a physical cube, you can turn on 'Scrambles' in the settings. You can also use the virtual cube, which can save a lot of time since you don't have to scramble. In addition, the virtual cube works on your phone.
