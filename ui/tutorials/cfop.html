    <h1>Learn CFOP for the Rubik's Cube</h1>
    <p>
        If you want to learn about CFOP and how to do it, you are in the right place.
        This tutorial is good for people who have learned the beginner method of the Rubik's Cube and want to start learning a more advanced method.
    </p>

    <h2 id="What-is-CFOP?">What is CFOP?</h2>
    <p>
        CFOP stands for Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL.
        It is also sometimes called the Fridrich method because it was popularized by Jessica Fridrich.
        However, some cubers say it is better to use a term like CFOP because it is more descriptive of the method.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each letter in CFOP stands for one of the steps, so as you can probably guess, CFOP is broken down into 4 steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cross</li>
        <li>First 2 layers (F2L)</li>
        <li>Orient last layer (OLL)</li>
        <li>Permute last layer (PLL)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="Why-use-CFOP?">Why use CFOP?</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of CFOP is to solve the cube faster than the beginner method.
    </p>
    <p>
        How does the CFOP method help with solving the Rubik's Cube faster?
        The main benefit is that it takes fewer moves than the beginner method.
        If you are familiar with the beginner method, you probably know that it includes 7 steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cross</li>
        <li>First layer</li>
        <li>Second layer</li>
        <li>Orient edges</li>
        <li>Orient corners</li>
        <li>Permute corners</li>
        <li>Permute edges</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        CFOP takes fewer moves than the beginner method because it combines steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First layer and second layer ➡ First 2 layers</li>
        <li>Orient edges and orient corners ➡ Orient last layer</li>
        <li>Permute corners and permute edges ➡ Permute last layer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You should already know how to solve the cross, so now we will jump straight into learning F2L!
    </p>
    <h2 id="F2L">F2L</h2>
    <p>
        F2L stands for First 2 Layers, and as the name implies, the goal is to solve the first 2 layers of the Rubik's Cube in one step.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are starting out with F2L, you want to learn the cases intuitively.
        That means you should understand how the pieces move instead of memorizing algorithms.
        As you become more advanced, you will start to ingrain the cases in your muscle memory, and you will be able to solve F2L without thinking deeply.

    </div>
    <h2 id="OLL">OLL</h2>
    <p>
        OLL stands for Orient Last Layer, and the goal is to orient the last layer of the Rubik's Cube.
        For example, if you started with the white cross, then the goal is to get all of the yellow stickers on top.
    </p>
    <p>
        This step is algorithmic, which means you just have to memorize algorithms.
        There are 57 algorithms for full OLL, but many of them are just mirrors or inverses of each other.
    </p>

        <div class="alg-stepper-text">
            <p>This is what OLL should look like when it's done.</p>

        ></iframe>
    </div>
    <h2 id="PLL">PLL</h2>
    <p>
        PLL stands for Permute Last Layer, and much like OLL, this step is also algorithmic.
        There are 21 algorithms for full PLL.
    </p>
    <div class="alg-stepper-card">
        <div class="alg-stepper-text">
            <p>After PLL, the entire cube should be finished!</p>
