    <h1>Learn PLL for the Rubik's Cube</h1>
    <p>
        This tutorial will teach you everything you need to know about PLL.
        We teach you how to identify PLL cases, how to learn PLL algorithms, and how to practice PLL.
        Keep reading if you are ready to permute some pieces!
    </p>
    <p>Disclaimer: There may be multiple good algorithms for some cases, but we will only show one.</p>

    <h2 id="What-is-PLL">What is PLL?</h2>
    <p>
        PLL is the last step of the CFOP method for the Rubik's Cube, and it stands for Permute Last Layer.
        In the beginner method, one way of solving last layer is to permute corners and then permute edges.
        PLL is more efficient because you perform one algorithm to permute the entire last layer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specifcally, PLL has 21 algorithms.
        You may know a couple of them from the beginner method depending on which variation you learned.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of the PLLs have nicknames.
        For example, "U perm" is a permutation that kind of looks like the letter U.
        The nicknames are inspired by the general shape of the permutation, and each is named after a letter.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Helpful-resources">Helpful resources</h2>
    <p>
        The best way to learn algorithms is with <i>spaced repetition</i>.
        The idea is that you learn the algorithms over time instead of all at once.
        The <a href="/train.html" class="link">CubingApp Trainer</a> spaces out the algorithms so you spend more time practicing the ones that need practice.
    </p>
    <p>
        CubingApp also has a page of <a href="/algdb/PLL.html" class="link">PLL algorithms</a> so you can see all of the fastest algorithms.

    <h2 id="U-perms">U perms</h2>
    <p>✅ 2 out of 21</p>
    <p>
        The U perms are some of the easiest cases to learn, and you may even know them from the beginner method already.
        U perms occur when all of the corners are solved and you have a solved bar.

                This algorithm is very similar because you just use U instead of U'.

        EPLL stands for Edge Permute Last Layer.
        The U perms are also considered EPLLs because they permute edges.
        The other 2 EPLLs are the H perm and Z perm, and they are also very easy to learn.

                F perm is also very similar to T perm, but there is a modification.
                You put R' U' F' at the beginning of the algorithm, and F U R at the end.
                However, the last move of T perm is an F', so you can cancel the F' and F.

        The G perms are challenging for most cubers to learn, but the algorithms can be executed fairly quickly once you have learned them.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are multiple G perm algorithms you can learn.
        I will show you one way of learning them that takes advantage of the mirrors and inverses so you can learn more easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can be difficult to determine which G perm case you have, because each case has a bar and headlights.
        You'll have to memorize where the bar and headlights are to determine which case you have.
