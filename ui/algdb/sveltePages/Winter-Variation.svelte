        <p>
            Winter Variation (also called WV) is an advanced variation that's useful for methods like CFOP and ZZ. When you are solving the last slot of F2L, you can use winter variation as long as the edges are oriented. Winter variation allows you to skip OLL by altering how you insert the last pair. This technique is commonly called 'influencing' OLL.
