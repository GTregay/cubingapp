        <h1>2x2 EG2 Algorithms</h1>
        <p>
            EG2 is commonly learned after EG1. CLL, EG1, and EG2 go hand in hand. These three algorithm sets will allow you to solve the entire cube after solving one face.

        <p>
            CLL: First layer is solved. This occurs 1/6th of the time<br>
            EG1: First layer has an adjacent swap. This occurs 4/6th of the time<br>
            EG2: First layer has a diagonal swap. This occurs 1/6th of the time
