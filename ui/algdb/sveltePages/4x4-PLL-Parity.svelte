        <h1>4x4 PLL Parity Algorithms</h1>
        <p>
            When you are solving a 4x4, PLL parity can significantly slow down a solve. Luckily, there are some tricks you can use to minimize the damage without learning too mamny new algorithms.

        <p>
            Some algorithms in this set are similar to PLL algorithms you already know, except there is a parity algorithm mixed in. By doing the parity algorithm strategically, you can turn a slow PLL into a fast PLL.
