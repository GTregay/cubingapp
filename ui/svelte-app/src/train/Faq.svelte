    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Why use this trainer?</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
        We use a memorization technique called <i>spaced repetition</i>. This
        means that you'll see an algorithm less often if you get it right, and
        more often if you get it wrong. The algorithms are automatically spaced
        out so you can memorize in the most efficient way possible.

        There are a couple ways to use this trainer. We provide a scramble so
        you can set up a case on your own cube, or you can use the virtual cube.
        To turn the virtual cube, you can use the keyboard or drag the cube.
